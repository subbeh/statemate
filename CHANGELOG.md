## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `mate status` and `mate apply` now detect permission mismatches — files with correct content but wrong permissions show as modified and get fixed on apply
- `perm-r`, `owner-r`, and `group-r` recursive attributes on directories now correctly propagate to child files
- Bitwarden provider now shows clear error messages when vault is locked or session is invalid instead of "unexpected end of JSON input"
- `mate encrypt` and `mate decrypt` now work with files outside the source tree (e.g. var_files in `.matedata/`)
- Encrypted var_files (`#encrypted` suffix) are now transparently decrypted during template rendering
- Tab completion now shows only files in the current directory tree with relative paths instead of all files with absolute paths

### Added
- `ignore` key in `mate.yaml` for gitignore-style patterns to exclude files from scanning (replaces `.mateignore` files)
- `ignore` key in per-source `.mate.yaml` for patterns scoped to that source only
- Documented the `STATEMATE_DIR` environment variable, which overrides `source_dir` to point at a different dotfiles directory
- Per-source `target_base` in `.mate.yaml` to deploy files to a different root directory
- `.mate.yaml` files now support template rendering (use variables like `{{ .Vars.workspace }}`)
- `mate add` prompts to create/update `.mate.yaml` when adding files outside home directory
- `mate packages apply` now shows package manager output during install/uninstall
- `generate` directive in `.mate.yaml` to dynamically create files from templates
- `indent` template function for proper YAML multiline content formatting
- `daily`, `weekly`, and `monthly` script frequencies for interval-based execution

### Changed
- `mate profile` now shows the sources that apply to the active profile

### Removed
- `.mateignore` files are no longer supported (use `ignore` in `mate.yaml` instead)
